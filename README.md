# Data--Science--Projects
Hi, I'am a graduate student at Northeastern University and a data science enthusiast. This repo consists of all the work I have covered in this field and would further be adding more to it. People are free to refer it if they like it. :)
This files contains mainly of various jupyter notebooks used for data analysis,cleansing,wrangling, predictions etc. on various data sets mainly coded in Python Programming language.
Topics covered are as follows :
1. Random Forest Algorithm
2. k-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm
3. Deep Neural Networks 
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
5. h2o autoML concepts
6. Hyper parameter tuning
7. Decision Trees
8. Gradient Boosting Algorithms
